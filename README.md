## Odin Recipes
A collection of recipes presented on a simple, well-structured website.

## Project Structure
-"index.html": Homepage with links to all recipes as seperate buttons.
-"recipes/": Folder containing individual recipe pages (lasagna.html, macaroni&cheese.html, steak&broccoli.html)

Each recipe page includes:
-A title and image of the dish
-A description of the dish
-A list of ingredients
-Step-by-step numbered instructions
-Navigation link back to the homepage styled as a button

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I practiced:

-Using headings, paragraphs, lists, and links correctly
-Structuring a multi-page website
-Creating relative links between files and folders
-Styling pages with CSS, including buttons, headings, lists, and images

## Future Improvements
